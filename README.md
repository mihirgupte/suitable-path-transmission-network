# suitable-path-transmission-network
this program is for distance vector algorithm to find suitable path for transmission on a network. you have to enter the no. of nodes and the distance between each node. if a path between nodes doesn't exist simply give input 99. it then calculates the shortest path between 2 nodes.

(yes i realise i have used a printf once even though its cpp)

## input format
* enter no. of nodes<br>
* enter path between ith and jth node<br>
 	enter 0 if same node and 99 if path doesn't exist
	
## output format
* it gives the routing table for each node in which the next destination and hops are given
* it then gives shortest distance bet. the 2 nodes entered
